				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>
					Music has always been a big part of my life. It is more than just
					a nice beat or random words, there is comfort in knowing that
					someone can describe exactly how you are feeling in a rythmic 3
					minutes. A song can hold years of culture and childhood memories
					that would have been forgotten otherwise. I truly and
					whole-heartedly believe music is another form of therapy!

				<h3>Dance</h3>
				<p>
					I do not think that I have any regrets in life because I believe
					everything happens for a reason, but if I were to ever have one
					it would stopping my dance career. There was a feeling of content
					and pure bliss whenever I danced. I do not think I will ever stop
					loving dance. I remember the three years of middle school where I
					dedicated my entire being into dance, from Hip-hop to
					contemporary the feeling is the same.

				<h3>Gym</h3>
				<p>
					Now I spend some of my free time in the gym. I am focused on
					weight trainning. I have to admit I am not as passionate about it
					as dance, but it comes very close. My goal is to be able to lift
					double my body weight with any muscle group. I have learned a lot
					through the process of getting serious in the gym regarding my
					body and nutrition.

				<h3>Chess</h3>
				<p>
					BEWARE! I am just a novice in chess, but over the four months
					that I have started learning how to play, I have to admit
					progress has been made! It is a thought-provoking game that I
					advise anyone and everyone to play. You have to be able to keep
					the ultimate goal in mind (checkmate) while dodging any fatal
					attacks from your opponent and maintaining your offensive
					position. It is exhilarating!
				</p>

				<h3>Religion and Spirituality</h3>
				<p>
					I am not one to discuss religion or anything of the sort because
					it is a sensitive topic for many; however, the journey I have
					begun this year in becoming more in tune with myself and
					everything I believe to be true is something I cannot omit. It is
					a journey that I am no where near finished and it is not easy yet
					I am excited to experience every second of it.
