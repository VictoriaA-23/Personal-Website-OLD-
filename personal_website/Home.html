Hello to everyone! My name is Victoria and I am a senior attending the University of South Florida.
I am hoping to graduate this December with my bachelor's in Interdisciplinary Sciences. A few facts
about me to break the ice...
<ul><li>I am 21 years old</li>
	<li>I was born and raised in Florida, but my entire family is from Dominican Republic</li>
	<li>I can speak English and Spanish, I also understand a little bit of French</li>
	<li>My favorite animals are penguins and ducks</li>
	<li>I have an older brother...he is super lame (dont tell him I said that)</li>
