This was the first website I ever built 💪🏻

 Although I was and still am very proud of this websiste, it does not my represent my skills and preferences today. However I still want to showcase this project to measure my progress. 
 - For this website I used iFrame to create my menu and embed my resume.
 - Overall I used a lot of styling and features in HTML rather than CSS or JS.
 
 Now that I have reflected... a toast to many more projects with thrice the progress. Cheers! 🥂
